- 64 Years ago a forward-thinking group of people joined forces to save St Helens Park and the Ancient gill woodlands, rare lowland meadows and abundant freshwaters ponds for the people of Hastings.
- Again today we need to unite to protect theses vulnerable ecosystems. The last vital Biodiversity corridor from the High Weald to our Ancient Woodlands is under threat.
- Sandrock Bends HL19 in the local plan has four owners.
- Three of the four owners of this area, Hastings Youth Trust, Mr Cooper and Hastings Borough Council have engaged a land promoter to stitch together their land and apply for planning permission to build up to 140 houses on the plot.
- Due to the large volume of objections East Sussex County Council received when they advertised their intention to dispose of the public open space and path that is owned by them, they state they have not reached a decision yet.

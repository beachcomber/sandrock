Anybody who lives downstream from The Ridge will know that a lot of surface water runs into the valleys, paths and roads around St. Helen’s Woods.

<h2 class="text-lime-900">In the area, heavy rains in recent years have led to:</h2>

- deep crevices appearing in unpaved roads (such as St Helen’s Wood Road) that residents have had to repair
- stream bank erosion
- falling trees
- landslips
- the undermining of the dam in St Helen’s Woods, resulting in the loss of the pond that supported a variety of wildlife

The unpredictability of rainfall is not expected to improve as climate change progresses.

In February 2025, a flood risk assessment report for the development, by HydroGround Civils, concluded that <q>A robust flood risk assessment will need to demonstrate how flood risk impact downstream as discussed in this report can be mitigated<q>.

It noted that there is a risk of flooding, and that <q>Improper management of surface water runoff generated by impermeable areas at the allocated land could potentially worsen this risk, with heavy impacts downstream<q>.

Currently, Sandrock Bends acts like a sponge, absorbing a good deal of this water. The development would remove this safety feature and worsen the chance of flooding, increasing the risk for the entire Blacklands Area, Alexander Park, and the town centre.

Anyone living downstream from The Ridge could be affected.
